  Micetrap opens a server on either a given or random port, emulating fake
  vulnerable services. Port scanners such as Nmap, when fingerprinting ports
  to discover service names and versions, will get apparently legitimate
  responses from common services such as FTP, HTTP or MySQL servers,
  therefore misleading potential attackers with false information.

  Depending on the operating system you are using, micetrap will try its best
  to +look feasible+ by choosing the appropriate fake services and versions
  to emulate. Whenever possible, micetrap will provide a bit outdated versions
  which are more likely to be vulnerable, and thus making the attacker focus
  on those ports. While the attacker tries to exploit these ports, she is
  essentially sending certain packets -- which get properly captured and
  logged my micetrap. This information might be useful to discover what kind
  of attacks are being tried against your machine, therefore giving you time
  and the opportunity to defend appropriately.

  Fire up a simple ftp micetrap like this:

        sudo micetrap ftp

  Running it with sudo will allow you to use default, unsuspicious ports,
  which may give you advantage at tricking a smart attacker.

  If you don't want to use system ports, you can run micetrap without having
  root privileges like this:

        micetrap ftp --port 9999   (or whatever non-system port you like)

  The available services are are:
    #{SERVICES.join(', ')}

  Usage:
        [sudo] micetrap <service> [options]

  where [options] are:
EOS
  opt :port, "A specific port to use", :default => nil, :type => :integer
  stop_on SERVICES
end
